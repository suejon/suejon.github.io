Welcome to the support page of my Korean Dictionary and Learning tool *HanByte*


**FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions):** 

- Why do i have to download a dictionary before using the app?
As an offline first application, we want to make sure that the performance and experience is as performant as possible. Downloading the dictionary first means that the app is usable even without internet so you can look things up at any time.

**Troubleshooting Guides:**

- Nothing is coming up when i search - try closing the application completely and then restarting it. Sometimes the dictionary is not loaded properly after downloading for the first time. We are working on this.

**Contact Information:** 

- If there are any concerns, suggestions for improvement or other queries, please contact me at jonothansue@gmail.com

**Release Notes:**

- Coming soonâ€¦
