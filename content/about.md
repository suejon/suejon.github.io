I am a experienced Full-Stack Engineer with a comprehensive background in developing and optimizing performance-critical applications for distributed systems. Having worked on infrastructure management, application development, automation, and monitoring and observability throughout the software delivery lifecycle, I consistently strive to design and implement robust and scalable software solutions with practical decision making and following leading practices.

As a big advocate for collaboration and communication, I believe teamwork and a solid team culture is key to success and future growth. Having lead both small and large scale teams, I have had the chance to contribute to evolving team culture, providing a safe environment for open discussion and communication.

Time is money, so i believe automation plays a huge role in delivering objectives efficiently. With several years of experience working in DevOps, I have established and contributed to core CICD automations that have saved countless hours of time which would have been spent manually running tasks or debugging as a result of human errors.
