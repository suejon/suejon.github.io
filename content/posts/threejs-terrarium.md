After discovering ThreeJS through some community projects i was inspired to create my own. I was particularly interested in how much effort it would take for someone who had absolutely no knowledge of the world of 3D graphical computing to make something more interesting than a spinning square.

So i came up with the idea of creating a virtual set of rooms that each had it's own unique environment where i could showcase my journey with ThreeJS and experiment with different ideas.
