While article-based language learning is quite popular, the content in the articles is not always that interesting to the reader. I want to create a foundation for the ability for users to search up news that they want to read and have tooling which would support the ability for the user to understand the article especially since typical news articles require quite a high language level to understand.

The live version of the website is here:
https://gofetch.vercel.app/

Keep in mind, this is a work in progress. However, the main features the app currently supports are:
- looking up articles in the database
- looking up words as you read by clicking on them and using the arrow keys (works even better on mobile with touch)
- supports switching the difficulty of the article to match your language level

This is something that I am chipping away at when I get time. I hope to add more features as time goes on.
